# HEADER: kᴮ CDML-number, Label of kᴮ∈Φ-Ω, Operation from Rkᴬ = kᴮ with R identified by a CDML-specific numbering scheme, Label of kᴬ∈Ω
# NOTE: We indicate the separation between space groups with a 0 in the first column (and a * in the last). 
#       E.g. to signify the start of a new space group - specifically space group no. 3 whose label is P2 - 
#       we have a row: 0, P2, 3, *
# NOTE: This file only includes k-points and operations for trigonal and hexagonal lattices
